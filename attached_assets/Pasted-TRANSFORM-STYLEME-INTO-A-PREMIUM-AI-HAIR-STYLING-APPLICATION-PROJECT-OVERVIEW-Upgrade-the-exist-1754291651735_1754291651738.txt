    const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ 
      video: { width: 640, height: 480, facingMode: 'user' } 
    });
    videoElement.srcObject = stream;
    showCameraControls();
  } catch (error) {
    showUploadFallback();
  }
}

// File upload with validation
function handleFileUpload(files) {
  const file = files[0];
  if (!file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
    showError('Please upload a valid image file');
    return;
  }
  processImage(file);
